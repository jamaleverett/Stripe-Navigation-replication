# Stripe-navigation-replication
Hey, everyone! 

I have always been intrigued with the Stripe Nav bar and decided to replicate it! For beginners, this is a great representation of how HTML, CSS, and JS work together! 

Take a look :) 

sidenote: if you have a keen eye, you'll notice the primary language is CSS due to it making up 56% of this representation.
